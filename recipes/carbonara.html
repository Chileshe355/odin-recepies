    <p>
        I have yet another super easy pasta dish for you all today. 
        And the best part about this dish is that you only need 5 ingredients to whip this up!
         No wait, the best part is the bacon. Yeah, the bacon.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li> tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; reserve 1/2 cup water and drain well.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and Parmesan; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes; reserve excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, stir in pasta and egg mixture, and gently toss to combine; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
